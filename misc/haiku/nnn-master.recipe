SUMMARY="A blazing-fast lightweight terminal file manager"
DESCRIPTION="nnn is a full-featured terminal file manager. It's tiny and \
nearly 0-config with an incredible performance.

nnn is also a du analyzer, an app launcher, a batch renamer and a file picker. \
The plugin repository has tons of plugins and documentation to extend the \
capabilities further. You can plug new functionality and play with a \
custom keybind instantly. There's an independent (neo)vim plugin.

It runs smoothly on the Raspberry Pi, Termux on Android, Linux, macOS, BSD, \
Cygwin, WSL, Haiku and works seamlessly with DEs and GUI utilities.

Visit the Wiki for concepts, program usage, how-tos and troubleshooting."
