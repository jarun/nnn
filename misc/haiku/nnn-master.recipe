SUMMARY="The missing terminal file manager for X"
DESCRIPTION="
nnn is a full-featured terminal file manager. It's tiny and nearly 0-config with an incredible performance.

nnn is also a du analyzer, an app launcher, a batch renamer and a file picker. The plugin repository has tons of plugins and documentation to extend the capabilities further. You can plug new functionality and play with a custom keybind instantly. There's an independent (neo)vim plugin.

It runs smoothly on the Raspberry Pi, Termux on Android, Linux, macOS, BSD, Cygwin, WSL and works seamlessly with DEs and GUI utilities.

Visit the Wiki for concepts, program usage, how-tos and troubleshooting.
