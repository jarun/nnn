# Contributing
Contributions to nnn are welcome! There's always an open issue with the current ToDo list, which contains the proposed features for the next release you can get your hands on. Any small changes or ideas should go in there, rather than in a separate issue.

Before suggesting changes, please read a bit about [the design principles nnn follows](https://github.com/jarun/nnn/wiki#design), and make sure you aren't breaking any of them.

## Coding standard

`nnn` follows the Linux kernel coding style closely. The C source code uses TABs and the plugins use 4 spaces for indentation.

CI runs `shellcheck` on plugins. Please watch out for any failures if you are modifying/adding a plugin.

## Resources
The [wiki](https://github.com/jarun/nnn/wiki/Developer-guides) has some resources for developers you might be interested in: building, debugging...

## Communication
* [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/jarun/nnn)
* [GitHub team](https://github.com/nnn-devs) (if you plan on contributing regularly, ask for an invitation).
