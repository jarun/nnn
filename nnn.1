.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
.Pq Nnn's Not Noice
is a performance-optimized, feature-packed fork of noice
.Em http://git.2f30.org/noice/
with seamless desktop integration, simplified navigation,
.Em type-to-nav
mode with dir auto-enter, disk usage analyzer mode, bookmarks,
contexts, application launcher, familiar navigation shortcuts,
subshell spawning and much more. It remains a simple and
efficient file manager that stays out of your way.
.Pp
.Nm
opens the current working directory if
.Ar PATH
is not specified. If
.Ar PATH
is specified and it exists,
.Nm
will open it. If the
.Ar PATH
doesn't exist and ends with a \fB/\fR,
.Nm
will attempt to create the directory tree and open it. Otherwise,
.Ar PATH
is considered a path to a regular file and
.Nm
attempts to create the complete directory tree to the file, open
the parent directory and prompt to create the new file in it with
the base filename.
.Sh KEYBINDS

.Sh CONFIGURATION
There is no configuration file. Associated files are at
.Pp
.Pa ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/nnn/
.Pp
Configuration is done using a few optional (set if you need) environment
variables. See ENVIRONMENT section.
.Pp
.Nm
uses \fIxdg-open\fR (on Linux), \fIopen(1)\fR (on macOS), \fIcygstart\fR on
(Cygwin) and \fIopen\fR on (Haiku) as the desktop opener. It's also possible
to specify a custom opener. See ENVIRONMENT section.
.Sh CONTEXTS
Open multiple locations with 4 contexts. The status is shown in the top left
corner:
.Pp
- the current context is in reverse video
.br
- other active contexts are underlined
.br
- rest are inactive
.Pp
A new context copies the state of the previous context. Each context can have
its own color. See ENVIRONMENT section.
.Sh SESSIONS
Sessions are a way to save and restore states of work. A session stores the
settings and contexts. Sessions can be loaded at runtime or with a program
option.
.Pp
- When a session is loaded at runtime, the last working state is saved
automatically to a dedicated "auto session" session file. Session option
\fIrestore\fR would restore the "auto session".
.br
- The persistent session option is global. If it is used, the last active session
will be updated with the final state at program quit.
.br
- The "auto session" is used in persistent session mode if no session is active.
.br
- Listing input stream and opening a bookmark by key have a higher priority to
session options (-s/-S).
.Pp
All the session files are located by session name in the directory
.Pp
\fB${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/nnn/sessions\fR
.Pp
"@" is the "auto session" file.
.Sh FILTERS
Filters are strings (or regex patterns) to find matching entries in the current
directory instantly (\fIsearch-as-you-type\fR). Matches are case-insensitive by
default. The last filter in each context is persisted at runtime or in saved
sessions.
.br
When there's a unique match and it's a directory,
.Nm
auto enters the directory. Use the relevant program option to disable this.
.Pp
Special keys at filter prompt:
.Bd -literal
-------- + ---------------------------------------
  Key    |                Function
-------- + ---------------------------------------
 ^char   | Usual keybind functionality
 Esc     | Exit filter prompt but skip dir refresh
 Alt+Esc | Unfilter, quit context
-------- + ---------------------------------------
.Ed
.Pp
Special keys at \fBempty filter prompt\fR:
.Bd -literal
------ + ---------------------------------------
  Key  |                Function
------ + ---------------------------------------
   ?   | Show help and config screen
   /   | Toggle between string and regex
   :   | Toggle case-sensitivity
  ^L   | Clear filter (\fIif prompt is non-empty\fR)
       | OR apply last filter
  Bksp | Stay at filter prompt and refresh dir
  Del  | Stay at filter prompt and refresh dir
------ + ---------------------------------------
.Ed
.Pp
Common regex use cases:
.Pp
(1) To list all matches starting with the filter expression,
    start the expression with a '^' (caret) symbol.
.br
(2) Type '\\.mkv' to list all MKV files.
.br
(3) Use '.*' to match any character (\fIsort of\fR fuzzy search).
.br
(4) Exclude filenames having 'nnn' (compiled with PCRE lib): '^(?!nnn)'
.Pp
In the \fBtype-to-nav\fR mode directories are opened in filter
mode, allowing continuous navigation.
.Pp
Additional special keys at \fBempty filter prompt\fR
in \fBtype-to-nav\fR mode:
.Bd -literal
------ + ------------------------
  Key  |         Function
------ + ------------------------
   '   | Go to first non-dir file
   +   | Toggle file selection
   ,   | Mark CWD
   -   | Go to last visited dir
   .   | Show hidden files
   ;   | Run a plugin by its key
   =   | Launch a GUI application
   >   | Export file list
   @   | Visit start dir
   ]   | Show command prompt
   `   | Visit /
   ~   | Go HOME
------ + ------------------------
.Ed
.Sh SELECTION
.Nm
allows file selection across directories and contexts!
.Pp
There are 3 groups of keybinds to add files to selection:
.Pp
(1) hovered file selection toggle
    - deselects if '+' is visible before the entry, else adds to selection
.br
(2) add a range of files to selection
    - repeat the range key on the same entry twice to clear selection completely
.br
(3) add all files in the current directory to selection
.Pp
A selection can be edited, copied, moved, removed, archived or linked.
.Pp
Absolute paths of the selected files are copied to \fB.selection\fR file in
the config directory. The selection file is shared between multiple program
instances. Selection from multiple instances are not merged. The last instance
writing to the file overwrites earlier contents. If you have 2 instances of
.Nm
\fIopen\fR in 2 panes of a terminal multiplexer, you can select in one pane and
use the selection in the other pane. The selection gets cleared in the
.Nm
instance where the selection was made on mv/rm (but not on cp).
.Pp
.Nm
clears the selection after a successful operation with the selection. Plugins
are allowed to define the behaviour individually.
.Pp
To edit the selection use the _edit selection_ key. Editing doesn't end the
selection mode. You can add more files to the selection and edit the list
again. If no file is selected in the current session, this option attempts
to list the selection file.
.Pp
.Nm
can show the total size of non-filtered selected files listed in a
directory. For directories, only the size of the directory is added by
default. To add the size of the contents of a directory, switch to du mode.
.Sh FIND AND LIST
There are two ways to search and list:
.Pp
- feed a list of file paths as input
.br
- search using a plugin (e.g. \fIfinder\fR) and list the results
.Pp
File paths must be NUL-separated ('\\0'). Paths and can be relative to the
current directory or absolute. Invalid paths in the input are ignored. Input
processing limit is 16,384 paths or 64 MiB (max_paths x max_path_len) of data.
.Pp
To list the input stream, start
.Nm
by writing to its standard input. E.g., to list files in current
directory larger than
1M:
.Bd -literal
    find -maxdepth 1 -size +1M -print0 | nnn
.Ed
.Pp
or redirect a list from a file:
.Bd -literal
    nnn < files.txt
.Ed
.Pp
Handy bash/zsh shell function to list files by mime-type in current directory:
.Bd -literal
    # to show video files, run: list video

    list ()
    {
        find . -maxdepth 1 | file -if- | grep "$1" | awk -F: '{printf "%s\0", $1}' | nnn
    }
.Ed
.Pp
A temporary directory will be created containing symlinks to the given
paths. Any action performed on these symlinks will be performed only on their
targets, after which they might become invalid.
.Pp
Right arrow or 'l' on a symlink in the listing dir takes to the target
file. Press '-' to return to the listing dir. Press 'Enter' to open the symlink.
.Pp
Listing input stream can be scripted. It can be extended to pick (option -p)
selected entries from the listed results.
.Sh BOOKMARKS
There are 2 ways (can be used together) to manage bookmarks.
.Pp
(1) Bookmark keys: See \fBNNN_BMS\fR under \fIENVIORNMENT\fR section on how to set
    bookmark keys.

    The select bookmark key \fIb\fR lists all the bookmark keys set in \fBNNN_BMS\fR
    in the bookmarks prompt.
.Pp
(2) Symlinked bookmarks: A symlinked bookmark to the current directory can
    be created with the \fIB\fR key (or manually under ~/.config/nnn/bookmarks).

    Pressing 'Enter' at the bookmarks prompt takes to this directory.
    If \fBNNN_BMS\fR is not set, the select bookmark key directly opens it.
.Pp
On entering a bookmark, the directory where the select bookmark key was
pressed is set as the previous directory. Press '-' to return to it.
.Pp
.Sh UNITS
The minimum file size unit is byte (B). The rest are K, M, G, T, P, E, Z, Y
(powers of 1024), same as the default units in \fIls\fR.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The SHELL, VISUAL (else EDITOR) and PAGER environment variables are
used. A single combination of arguments is supported for SHELL and PAGER.
.Pp
\fBNNN_OPTS:\fR binary options to
.Nm
.Bd -literal
    export NNN_OPTS="cEnrx"
.Ed
.Pp
\fBNNN_OPENER:\fR specify a custom file opener.
.Bd -literal
    export NNN_OPENER=nuke

    NOTE: 'nuke' is a file opener available in the plugin repository.
.Ed
.Pp
\fBNNN_BMS:\fR bookmark string as \fIkey_char:location\fR pairs
separated by \fI;\fR:
.Bd -literal
    export NNN_BMS="d:$HOME/Docs;u:/home/user/Cam Uploads;D:$HOME/Downloads/"
.Ed
.Pp
These bookmarks are listed in the help and config screen (key ?).
.Pp
\fBNNN_PLUG:\fR directly executable plugins as \fIkey_char:plugin\fR pairs
separated by \fI;\fR:
.Bd -literal
    export NNN_PLUG='f:finder;o:fzopen;p:mocplay;d:diffs;t:nmount;v:imgview'

    NOTES:
    1. To run a plugin directly, press \fI;\fR followed by the key.
    2. Alternatively, combine with \fIAlt\fR (i.e. \fIAlt+key\fR).
    3. To skip directory refresh after running a plugin, prefix with \fB-\fR.

    export NNN_PLUG='p:-plugin'
.Ed
.Pp
    To assign keys to arbitrary non-background cli commands and invoke like
    plugins, add \fB!\fR before the command.
.Bd -literal
    export NNN_PLUG='x:!chmod +x "$nnn";g:!git log;s:!smplayer "$nnn"'

    To pick and run an unassigned plugin, press \fBEnter\fR at the plugin prompt.
    To run a plugin at startup, use the option `-P` followed by the plugin key.

    NOTES:
    1. Place $nnn (or exported variables) in double quotes (\fB"$nnn"\fR)
    2. Use single quotes for $NNN_PLUG so "$nnn" is not interpreted
    3. (Again) add \fB!\fR before the command
    4. To disable directory refresh after running a \fIcommand as plugin\fR,
       prefix with \fB-!\fR
    5. To skip user confirmation after command execution, suffix with \fB*\fR
       Note: Do not use \fB*\fR with programs those run and exit e.g. cat

        export NNN_PLUG='y:-!sync*'

    6. To run a \fIGUI app as plugin\fR, add a \fB&\fR after \fB!\fR.

        export NNN_PLUG='m:-!&mousepad "$nnn"'

    7. To show the output of run-and-exit commands which do not need user input,
       add \fB|\fR (pipe) after \fB!\fR
       Note: This option is incompatible with \fB&\fR (terminal output is masked
       for GUI programs) and ignores \fB*\fR (output is already paged for user).

        export NNN_PLUG='m:-!|mediainfo "$nnn";t:-!|tree -ps;l:-!|ls -lah --group-directories-first'
