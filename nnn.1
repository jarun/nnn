.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
(Nnn's Not Noice) is a performance-optimized, feature-packed fork of noice (http://git.2f30.org/noice/) with seamless desktop integration, simplified navigation, \fInavigate-as-you-type\fR mode with auto select, disk usage analyzer mode, bookmarks, contexts, application launcher, familiar navigation shortcuts, subshell spawning and much more. It remains a simple and efficient file manager that stays out of your way.
.Pp
.Nm
opens the current working directory by default if
.Ar PATH
is not specified.
.Sh KEYBINDS
.Pp
Press \fB?\fR in
.Nm
to see the list of keybinds.

.Sh CONFIGURATION
.Nm
uses \fIxdg-open\fR (on Linux) and \fIopen(1)\fR (on macOS) as the desktop opener.
.Pp
There is no configuration file. Associated files are stored in \fB${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/nnn/\fR. Settings work on environment variables. See ENVIRONMENT section below.
.Sh CONTEXTS
Contexts serve the purpose of exploring multiple directories simultaneously. 4 contexts
are available. The status of the contexts are shown in the top left corner:
.Pp
- the current context is in reverse video
.br
- other active contexts are underlined
.br
- rest are inactive
.Pp
On context creation, the state of the previous context is copied. Each context remembers its last visited directory.
.Pp
Each context can have its own directory color specified. See ENVIRONMENT section below.
.Sh SESSIONS
Sessions are a way to save and restore states of work. A session stores the settings and contexts.
.Pp
Sessions can be loaded dynamically from within a running
.Nm
instance, or with a program option.
.Pp
When a session is loaded dynamically, the last working session is saved automatically to a dedicated
-- "last session" -- session file.
.Pp
All the session files are located in the \fB${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/nnn/sessions\fR directory by the session name.
"@" is the "last session" file.
.Sh FILTERS
Filters support regexes (default) to instantly (search-as-you-type) list the matching
entries in the current directory.
.Pp
Common use cases:
.Pp
(1) To list all matches starting with the filter expression, start the expression
with a '^' (caret) symbol.
.br
(2) Type '\\.mkv' to list all MKV files.
.br
(3) Use '.*' to match any character (\fIsort of\fR fuzzy search).
.Pp
There is a program option to filter entries by substring match instead of regex.
.Pp
There is a program option to execute the current filter as a command when the prompt key is pressed.
.Pp
In the \fInavigate-as-you-type\fR mode directories are opened in filter mode,
allowing continuous navigation. Works best with the \fBarrow keys\fR.
.br
When there's a unique match and it's a directory,
.Nm
auto selects the directory and enters it in this mode.
.Sh SELECTION
There are 3 groups of shortcuts to add files to selection:
.Pp
(1) add an individual file to selection
.br
(2) add a range of files to selection
.br
(3) add all files in the current directory to selection
.Pp
Selected files are visually indicated by a \fI+\fR before the entries.
.br
The selection can now be listed, copied, moved, removed, archived or linked.
.br
Absolute paths of the selected files are copied to the temporary file \fB.selection\fR in the config directory. The path is shown in the help and configuration screen. If \fB$NNN_COPIER\fR is set (see ENVIRONMENT section below) the file paths are also copied to the system clipboard.
.Pp
Repeat range selection on the same entry to clear selection. It's also possible to edit the current selection.
.Pp
Deselecting a single file is not implemented because substantial string processing would be required if thousands of files are selected. It would have been trivial if the selection was limited to a single directory (use a flag for each file and select the files with the flag set). However,
.Nm
allows selection across directories making it non-trivial to do that. Also, the buffer used to select is a compact one (no byte wasted) so \fBmemmove\fR() would be required to deselect each intermediate file. Considering these, the alternatives were chosen.
.Sh FILE SIZE
The minimum file size unit is byte (B). The rest are K, M, G, T, P, E, Z, Y (powers of 1024), same as the default units in \fIls\fR.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The SHELL, EDITOR (VISUAL, if defined) and PAGER environment variables take precedence
when dealing with the !, e and p commands respectively. A single combination to arguments is supported for SHELL and PAGER.
.Pp
\fBNNN_BMS:\fR bookmark string as \fIkey_char:location\fR pairs (max 10) separated by
\fI;\fR:
.Bd -literal
    export NNN_BMS='d:~/Documents;u:/home/user/Cam Uploads;D:~/Downloads/'

    NOTE: To go to a bookmark, press the Lead key followed by the bookmark key.
.Ed
.Pp
\fBNNN_PLUG:\fR directly executable plugins as \fIkey_char:location\fR pairs (max 10) separated by
\fI;\fR:
.Bd -literal
    export NNN_PLUG='o:fzy-open;p:mocplay;d:ndiff;m:nmount;t:thumb;i:mediainf'

    NOTE: To run a plugin directly, press \fI:\fR followed by the plugin key.
.Ed
.Pp
    To assign keys to arbitrary non-background cli commands (non-shell-interpreted) and invoke like plugins, add \fI_\fR (underscore) before the command.
.Bd -literal
    export NNN_PLUG='x:_chmod +x $NNN;g:_git log;s:_smplayer $NNN;o:fzopen'

    NOTES:
    1. Use single quotes for $NNN_PLUG so $NNN is not interpreted
    2. $NNN should be the last argument (IF you want to pass the hovered file name)
    3. (Again) add \fI_\fR before the command
.Ed
.Pp
\fBNNN_USE_EDITOR:\fR use VISUAL (else EDITOR, preferably CLI, fallback vi) to handle text files.
.Bd -literal
    export NNN_USE_EDITOR=1
.Ed
.Pp
\fBNNN_CONTEXT_COLORS:\fR string of color codes for each context, e.g.:
.Bd -literal
    export NNN_CONTEXT_COLORS='1234'

    codes: 0-black, 1-red, 2-green, 3-yellow, 4-blue (default), 5-magenta, 6-cyan, 7-white
.Ed
.Pp
\fBNNN_SSHFS_OPTS:\fR pass additional options to sshfs command:
.Bd -literal
    export NNN_SSHFS_OPTS='sshfs -o reconnect,idmap=user,cache_timeout=3600'

    NOTE: The options must be preceded by `sshfs` and comma-separated without any space between them.
.Ed
.Pp
\fBNNN_OPENER:\fR specify a custom file opener.
.Bd -literal
    export NNN_OPENER=mimeopen
.Ed
.Pp
\fBNNN_IDLE_TIMEOUT:\fR set idle timeout (in seconds) to invoke terminal locker (default: disabled).
.Pp
\fBNNN_COPIER:\fR system clipboard copier script. The project page has some sample copier scripts.
.Pp
\fBNNN_TRASH:\fR trash (instead of \fIdelete\fR) files to desktop Trash.
.Bd -literal
    export NNN_TRASH=1
.Ed
.Pp
\fBNNN:\fR this is a special variable set to the current entry before executing a command from the command prompt or spawning a shell.
.Sh KNOWN ISSUES
.Nm
may not handle keypresses correctly when used with tmux (see issue #104 for more details). Set \fBTERM=xterm-256color\fR to address it.
