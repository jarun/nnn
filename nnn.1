.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
(Nnn's Not Noice) is a performance-optimized, feature-packed fork of
noice (http://git.2f30.org/noice/) with seamless desktop
integration, simplified navigation, \fItype-to-nav\fR mode with
auto select, disk usage analyzer mode, bookmarks, contexts, application
launcher, familiar navigation shortcuts, subshell spawning and much
more. It remains a simple and efficient file manager that stays out of your way.

.Sh CONFIGURATION
There is no configuration file. Associated files are at
.Pp
\fB${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/nnn/\fR
.Pp
Configuration is done using a few optional (set if you need) environment
variables. See ENVIRONMENT section.
.Pp
.Nm
uses \fIxdg-open\fR (on Linux), \fIopen(1)\fR (on macOS), \fIcygstart\fR on
(Cygwin) and \fIopen\fR on (Haiku) as the desktop opener. It's also possible
to specify a custom opener. See ENVIRONMENT section.
.Sh CONTEXTS
Open multiple locations with 4 contexts. The status is shown in the top left
corner:
.Pp
- the current context is in reverse video
.br
- other active contexts are underlined
.br
- rest are inactive
.Pp
A new context copies the state of the previous context. Each context can have
its own color. See ENVIRONMENT section.
.Sh SESSIONS
Sessions are a way to save and restore states of work. A session stores the
settings and contexts.
.Pp
Sessions can be loaded dynamically at runtime or with a program option.
.Pp
When a session is loaded dynamically, the last working session is saved
automatically to a dedicated -- "last session" -- session file. The "last
session" is also used in persistent session mode.
.Pp
Listing input stream has a higher priority to session options (-s/-S). Sessions
can be loaded explicitly at runtime. Session option \fIrestore\fR would restore
the persistent session at runtime.
.Pp
All the session files are located by session name in the directory
.Pp
\fB${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/nnn/sessions\fR
.Pp
"@" is the "last session" file.
.Sh FILTERS
Filters are strings (or regex patterns) to find matching entries in the current
directory instantly (\fIsearch-as-you-type\fR). Matches are case-insensitive by
default. The last filter in each context is persisted at runtime or in saved
sessions.
.Pp
Special keys at filter prompt:
.Bd -literal
-------- + ---------------------------------------
  Key    |                Function
-------- + ---------------------------------------
 ^char   | Usual keybind functionality
 Esc     | Exit filter prompt but skip dir refresh
 Alt+Esc | Exit filter prompt and refresh dir
-------- + ---------------------------------------
.Ed
.Pp
Special keys at \fBempty filter prompt\fR:
.Bd -literal
------ + ---------------------------------------
  Key  |                Function
------ + ---------------------------------------
   ?   | Show help and config screen
   /   | Toggle between string and regex
   :   | Toggle case-sensitivity
  ^L   | Clear filter (\fIif prompt is non-empty\fR)
       | OR apply last filter
------ + ---------------------------------------
.Ed
.Pp
Additional special keys at \fBempty filter prompt\fR
in \fBtype-to-nav\fR mode:
.Bd -literal
------ + ------------------------
  Key  |         Function
------ + ------------------------
   '   | Go to first non-dir file
   +   | Toggle auto-advance
   ,   | Mark CWD
   -   | Go to last visited dir
   .   | Show hidden files
   ;   | Run a plugin by its key
   =   | Launch a GUI application
   >   | Export file list
   @   | Visit start dir
   ]   | Show command prompt
   `   | Visit /
   ~   | Go HOME
------ + ------------------------
.Ed
.Pp
Common regex use cases:
.Pp
(1) To list all matches starting with the filter expression,
    start the expression with a '^' (caret) symbol.
.br
(2) Type '\\.mkv' to list all MKV files.
.br
(3) Use '.*' to match any character (\fIsort of\fR fuzzy search).
.br
(4) Exclude filenames having 'nnn' (compiled with PCRE lib): '^(?!nnn)'
.Pp
In the \fItype-to-nav\fR mode directories are opened in filter
mode, allowing continuous navigation.
.br
When there's a unique match and it's a directory,
.Nm
auto selects the directory and enters it in this mode. Use the relevant
program option to disable this behaviour.
.Sh SELECTION
.Nm
allows file selection across directories and contexts!
.Pp
There are 3 groups of keybinds to add files to selection:
.Pp
(1) hovered file selection toggle
    - deselects if '+' is visible before the entry, else adds to selection
.br
(2) add a range of files to selection
    - repeat the range key on the same entry twice to clear selection completely
.br
(3) add all files in the current directory to selection
.Pp
A selection can be edited, copied, moved, removed, archived or linked.
.Pp
Absolute paths of the selected files are copied to \fB.selection\fR file in
the config directory. The selection file is shared between multiple program
instances. The most recent instance writing to the file overwrites the entries
from earlier writes. If you have 2 instances if
.Nm
\fIopen\fR in 2 panes of a terminal multiplexer, you can select in one pane and
use the selection (e.g. to copy or move) in the other pane (if the instance
doesn't have any local selection already).
.Pp
.Nm
clears the selection after file removal, batch-rename and link creation with
selection. However, it is retained after archive creation with selection as
the user may want to delete the archived files next.
.Pp
To edit the selection use the _edit selection_ key. Use this key to remove a
file from selection after you navigate away from its directory. Editing doesn't
end the selection mode. You can add more files to the selection and edit the
list again. If no file is selected in the current session, this option attempts
to list the selection file.
.Sh FIND AND LIST
There are two ways to search and list:
.Pp
- feed a list of file paths as input
.br
- search using a plugin (e.g. \fIfinder\fR) and list the results
.Pp
File paths must be NUL-separated ('\\0'). Paths and can be relative to the
current directory or absolute. Invalid paths in the input are ignored. Input
limit is 65,536 paths or 256 MiB of data.
.Pp
To list the input stream, start
.Nm
by writing to its standard input. E.g., to list files in current
directory larger than
1M:
.Bd -literal
    find -maxdepth 1 -size +1M -print0 | nnn
.Ed
.Pp
or redirect a list from a file:
.Bd -literal
    nnn < files.txt
.Ed
.Pp
Handy bash/zsh shell function to list files by mime-type in current directory:
.Bd -literal
    # to show video files, run: list video

    list ()
    {
        find . -maxdepth 1 | file -if- | grep "$1" | awk -F: '{printf "%s\0", $1}' | nnn
    }
.Ed
.Pp
A temporary directory will be created containing symlinks to the given
paths. Any action performed on these symlinks will be performed only on their
targets, after which they might become invalid.
.Pp
Right arrow or 'l' on a symlink in the listing dir takes to the target
file. Press '-' to return to the listing dir. Press 'Enter' to open the symlink.
.Pp
Listing input stream can be scripted. It can be extended to pick (option -p)
selected entries from the listed results.
.Sh UNITS
The minimum file size unit is byte (B). The rest are K, M, G, T, P, E, Z, Y
(powers of 1024), same as the default units in \fIls\fR.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The SHELL, VISUAL (else EDITOR) and PAGER environment variables are
used. A single combination of arguments is supported for SHELL and PAGER.
.Pp
\fBNNN_OPTS:\fR binary options to
.Nm
.Bd -literal
    export NNN_OPTS="cEnrx"
.Ed
.Pp
\fBNNN_OPENER:\fR specify a custom file opener.
.Bd -literal
    export NNN_OPENER=nuke

    NOTE: 'nuke' is a file opener available in the plugin repository.
.Ed
.Pp
\fBNNN_BMS:\fR bookmark string as \fIkey_char:location\fR pairs
separated by \fI;\fR:
.Bd -literal
    export NNN_BMS='d:~/Documents;u:/home/user/Cam Uploads;D:~/Downloads/'
.Ed
.Pp
\fBNNN_PLUG:\fR directly executable plugins as \fIkey_char:plugin\fR pairs
separated by \fI;\fR:
.Bd -literal
    export NNN_PLUG='f:finder;o:fzopen;p:mocplay;d:diffs;t:nmount;v:imgview'

    NOTES:
    1. To run a plugin directly, press \fI;\fR followed by the key.
    2. Alternatively, combine with \fIAlt\fR (i.e. \fIAlt+key\fR).
    3. To skip directory refresh after running a plugin, prefix with \fB-\fR.

    export NNN_PLUG='m:-mediainf'
.Ed
.Pp
    To assign keys to arbitrary non-background non-shell-interpreted cli
    commands and invoke like plugins, add \fI_\fR (underscore) before the
    command.
.Bd -literal
    export NNN_PLUG='x:_chmod +x $nnn;g:_git log;s:_smplayer $nnn'

    To pick and run an unassigned plugin, press \fBEnter\fR at the plugin prompt.
    To run a plugin at startup, use the option `-P` followed by the plugin key.

    NOTES:
    1. Use single quotes for $NNN_PLUG so $nnn is not interpreted
    2. $nnn should be the last argument (IF used)
    3. (Again) add \fB_\fR before the command
    4. To disable directory refresh after running a \fIcommand as plugin\fR,
       prefix with \fB-_\fR
    5. To skip user confirmation after command execution, suffix with \fB*\fR
       Note: Do not use \fB*\fR with programs those run and exit e.g. cat

    export NNN_PLUG='y:-_sync*'

    6. To run a \fIGUI app as plugin\fR, add a \fB|\fR after \fB_\fR

    export NNN_PLUG='m:-_|mousepad $nnn'
