.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
(Nnn's Not Noice) is a performance-optimized, feature-packed fork of
noice (http://git.2f30.org/noice/) with seamless desktop
integration, simplified navigation, \fInavigate-as-you-type\fR mode with
auto select, disk usage analyzer mode, bookmarks, contexts, application
launcher, familiar navigation shortcuts, subshell spawning and much
more.It remains a simple and efficient file manager that stays out of your way.
.Pp
.Nm
opens the current working directory by default if
.Ar PATH
is not specified.
.Sh KEYBINDS
.Pp
Press \fB?\fR in
.Nm
to see the list of keybinds.

.Sh CONFIGURATION
There is no configuration file. Associated files are at
.Pp
\fB${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/nnn/\fR
.Pp
Configuration is done using a few optional (set if you need) environment
variables. See ENVIRONMENT section.
.Pp
.Nm
uses \fIxdg-open\fR (on Linux), \fIopen(1)\fR (on macOS), \fIcygstart\fR on
(Cygwin) and \fIopen\fR on (Haiku) as the desktop opener. It's also possible
to specify a custom opener. See ENVIRONMENT section.
.Sh CONTEXTS
Contexts serve the purpose of exploring multiple directories simultaneously. 4
contexts are available. The status of the contexts are shown in the top left
corner:
.Pp
- the current context is in reverse video
.br
- other active contexts are underlined
.br
- rest are inactive
.Pp
On context creation, the state of the previous context is copied. Each context
remembers its last visited directory.
.Pp
Each context can have its own directory color specified. See ENVIRONMENT
section.
.Sh SESSIONS
Sessions are a way to save and restore states of work. A session stores the
settings and contexts.
.Pp
Sessions can be loaded dynamically from within a running
.Nm
instance, or with a program option.
.Pp
When a session is loaded dynamically, the last working session is saved
automatically to a dedicated -- "last session" -- session file.
.Pp
All the session files are located by session name in the directory
.Pp
\fB${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/nnn/sessions\fR
.Pp
"@" is the "last session" file.
.Sh FILTERS
Filters are strings to find matching entries in the current directory
instantly (\fIsearch-as-you-type\fR). There is a program option to switch to
regex filters. Matches are case-insensitive by default. In each context the
last filter is persisted at runtime or in saved sessions.
.Pp
Special keys at empty filter prompt:
.Pp
- toggle between string and regex: '/'
.br
- toggle case sensitivity: ':'
.br
- apply the last filter (or clear filter if non-empty): '^L'
.br
- show help and config screen: '?'
.br
- show command prompt: ']'
.br
- launch an application: '='
.br
- run a plugin by its key: ';'
.br
- pin current directory: ','
.Pp
Other noteworthy keys:
.Pp
- '^char': usual keybind functionality
.br
- 'Esc': exit filter prompt but skip dir refresh
.Pp
Common regex use cases:
.Pp
(1) To list all matches starting with the filter expression,
    start the expression with a '^' (caret) symbol.
.br
(2) Type '\\.mkv' to list all MKV files.
.br
(3) Use '.*' to match any character (\fIsort of\fR fuzzy search).
.Pp
In the \fInavigate-as-you-type\fR mode directories are opened in filter
mode, allowing continuous navigation. Works best with the \fBarrow keys\fR.
.br
When there's a unique match and it's a directory,
.Nm
auto selects the directory and enters it in this mode. Use the relevant
program option to disable this behaviour.
.Sh SELECTION
.Nm
allows file selection across directories and contexts!
.Pp
There are 3 groups of keybinds to add files to selection:
.Pp
(1) hovered file selection toggle (deselects if '+' is visible before the
    entry, else adds to selection)
.br
(2) add a range of files to selection (repeat the range key on the same entry
    twice to clear selection completely)
.br
(3) add all files in the current directory to selection
.Pp
A selection can be edited, copied, moved, removed, archived or linked.
.Pp
Absolute paths of the selected files are copied to \fB.selection\fR file in
the config directory.
.Pp
To edit the selection use the _edit selection_ key. Use this key to remove a
file from selection after you navigate away from its directory. Editing doesn't
end the selection mode. You can add more files to the selection and edit the
list again. If no file is selected in the current session, this option attempts
to list the selection file.
.Sh LIST FILES
.Nm
can receive a list of files as input. The paths should be NUL-separated ('\\0')
but doesn't need to be NUL-terminated. Paths and can be relative to the current
directory or absolute.
.Pp
Input is limited by 65,536 paths or 256 MiB of input.
.Pp
Start
.Nm
in this mode by writing to its standard input. So the output of another command
can be piped to it. For example, to list files in current directory larger than
1M:
.Bd -literal
    find -maxdepth 1 -size +1M -print0 | nnn
.Ed
.Pp
or you can redirect a list from a file:
.Bd -literal
    nnn < files.txt
.Ed
.Pp
A temporary directory will be created containing symlinks to the given
paths. Any action performed on these symlinks will be performed only on their
targets, after which they might become invalid.
.Pp
Though the term "files" is used, any input is valid as long as it's a valid
path. \fBInvalid paths are ignored.\fR
.Sh UNITS
The minimum file size unit is byte (B). The rest are K, M, G, T, P, E, Z, Y
(powers of 1024), same as the default units in \fIls\fR.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The SHELL, EDITOR (VISUAL, if defined) and PAGER environment variables are
used. A single combination of arguments is supported for SHELL and PAGER.
.Pp
\fBNNN_OPENER:\fR specify a custom file opener.
.Bd -literal
    export NNN_OPENER=nuke

    NOTE: `nuke` is a file opener available in plugin repository
.Ed
.Pp
\fBNNN_BMS:\fR bookmark string as \fIkey_char:location\fR pairs
(max 10) separated by \fI;\fR:
.Bd -literal
    export NNN_BMS='d:~/Documents;u:/home/user/Cam Uploads;D:~/Downloads/'

    NOTE: To go to a bookmark, press the Lead key followed by the bookmark key.
.Ed
.Pp
\fBNNN_PLUG:\fR directly executable plugins as \fIkey_char:location\fR pairs
(max 15) separated by \fI;\fR:
.Bd -literal
    export NNN_PLUG='o:fzopen;p:mocplay;d:diffs;m:nmount;t:imgthumb'

    NOTES:
    1. To run a plugin directly, press \fI;\fR followed by the plugin key
    2. To skip directory refresh after running a plugin, prefix with \fB-\fR

    export NNN_PLUG='m:-mediainfo'
.Ed
.Pp
    To assign keys to arbitrary non-background non-shell-interpreted cli
    commands and invoke like plugins, add \fI_\fR (underscore) before the
    command.
.Bd -literal
    export NNN_PLUG='x:_chmod +x $nnn;g:_git log;s:_smplayer $nnn;o:fzopen'

    NOTES:
    1. Use single quotes for $NNN_PLUG so $nnn is not interpreted
    2. $nnn should be the last argument (IF used)
    3. (Again) add \fB_\fR before the command
    4. To disable directory refresh after running a \fIcommand as plugin\fR,
       prefix with \fB-_\fR
    5. To skip user confirmation after command execution, suffix with \fB*\fR

    export NNN_PLUG='y:-_sync*'

    6. To run a \fIGUI app as plugin\fR, add a \fB|\fR after \fB_\fR

    export NNN_PLUG='m:-_|mousepad $nnn'

    EXAMPLES:
    ----------------------------------- + -------------------------------------------------
                Key:Command             |                   Description

.Sh KNOWN ISSUES
.Nm
may not handle keypresses correctly when used with tmux (see issue #104 for
more details). Set \fBTERM=xterm-256color\fR to address it.
