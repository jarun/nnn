<p align="center"><i>nnn in action!</i></a></p>

`nnn` is probably the [fastest and most resource-sensitive](#performance) (with all its capabilities) file browser you have ever used. It's extremely flexible too - integrates with your DE and favourite GUI utilities, works with the desktop opener, supports bookmarks, has smart navigation shortcuts, [navigate-as-you-type](#navigate-as-you-type-mode) mode, disk usage analyzer mode, comprehensive file details and much more. `nnn` was initially forked from [noice](http://git.2f30.org/noice/) but is significantly [different](https://github.com/jarun/nnn/wiki/nnn-vs.-noice) today.

Cool things you can do with `nnn`:

- open any file in the default desktop application or a custom one
- *navigate-as-you-type* (*search-as-you-type* enabled even on directory switch)
- check disk usage with number of files in current directory tree
- run desktop search utility (gnome-search-tool or catfish) in any directory
- copy absolute file path to clipboard, spawn a terminal and use the file path
- navigate instantly using shortcuts like `~`, `-`, `&` or handy bookmarks
- use `cd .....` at chdir prompt to go to a parent directory
- detailed file stats, media info, list and extract archives
- pin a directory you may need to revisit and jump to it anytime
- lock the current terminal after a specified idle time
- change directory on exit

If you want to edit a file in vim with some soothing music in the background while referring to a spec in your GUI PDF viewer, `nnn` got it! [Quickstart](#quickstart) and see how `nnn` simplifies those long desktop sessions...

Help & settings, file details, media info and archive listing are shown in the PAGER. Please use the PAGER-specific keys in these screens.

#### Filters

Filters support regexes to instantly (search-as-you-type) list the matching entries in the current directory.

There are 3 ways to reset a filter:
- pressing <kbd>^L</kbd>
- a search with no matches
- an extra backspace at the filter prompt (like vi)

Common use cases:
- to list all matches starting with the filter expression, start the expression with a `^` (caret) symbol
- type `\.mkv` to list all MKV files

If `nnn` is invoked as root the default filter will also match hidden files.

#### Navigate-as-you-type mode

In this mode directories are opened in filter mode, allowing continuous navigation. Works best with the **arrow keys**.

#### File type abbreviations

The following abbreviations are used in the detail view:

| Symbol | File Type |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Directory |
| `*` | Executable |
| <code>&#124;</code> | Fifo |
| `=` | Socket |
| `@` | Symbolic Link |
| `b` | Block Device |
| `c` | Character Device |

#### File handling

- `nnn` uses `xdg-open` on Linux and `open(1)` on OS X as the desktop opener.
- To edit all text files in EDITOR (preferably CLI, fallback vi):

      export NNN_USE_EDITOR=1
- To enable the desktop file manager key, set `NNN_DE_FILE_MANAGER`. E.g.:

      export NNN_DE_FILE_MANAGER=thunar
      export NNN_DE_FILE_MANAGER=nautilus
- [mediainfo](https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo) (or [exiftool](https://sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/), if specified) is required to view media information
- [atool](http://www.nongnu.org/atool/) is required to list and extract archives

#### Help

    $ nnn -h
    $ man nnn
To lookup keyboard shortcuts at runtime, press <kbd>?</kbd>.

### Quickstart

Add the following to your shell's rc file for the best experience:

1. Use a shorter and sweeter alias:

       alias n=nnn
2. Optionally open all text files in EDITOR (fallback vi):

       export NNN_USE_EDITOR=1
3. Set a desktop file manager to open directories with (if you ever need to). E.g.:

       export NNN_DE_FILE_MANAGER=thunar

4. Run `n`.

5. Set `NNN_NOWAIT`, if nnn [blocks on your desktop environment](#nnn-blocks-on-opening-files) when a file is open.

### How to

#### add bookmarks

Set environment variable `NNN_BMS` as a string of `key:location` pairs (max 10) separated by semicolons (`;`):

    export NNN_BMS='doc:~/Documents;u:/home/user/Cam Uploads;D:~/Downloads/'

#### use cd .....

To jump to the n<sup>th</sup> level parent, with PWD at level 0, use `n + 1` dots. For example, to jump to the 6<th> parent of the current directory, use 7 dots. If the number of dots would take you *beyond* `/` (which isn't possible), you'll be placed at `/`.

#### cd on quit

Pick the appropriate file for your shell from [`scripts/quitcd`](scripts/quitcd) and add the contents to your shell's rc file. You'll need to spawn a new shell for the change to take effect. You should start `nnn` as `n` (or modify the function name to something else).

As you might notice, `nnn` uses the environment variable `NNN_TMPFILE` to write the last visited directory path. You can change it.

#### copy file path to clipboard

`nnn` can pipe the absolute path of the current file to a copier script. For example, you can use `xsel` on Linux or `pbcopy` on OS X.

Sample Linux copier script:

    #!/bin/sh

    echo -n $1 | xsel --clipboard --input

export `NNN_COPIER`:

    export NNN_COPIER="/path/to/copier.sh"

Start `nnn` and use <kbd>^K</kbd> to copy the absolute path (from `/`) of the file under the cursor to clipboard.

#### change dir color

The default color for directories is blue. Option `-c` accepts color codes from 0 to 7 to use a different color:

    0-black, 1-red, 2-green, 3-yellow, 4-blue, 5-magenta, 6-cyan, 7-white

Any other value disables colored directories.

#### file copy, move, delete

`nnn` doesn't support file copy, move, delete inherently. However, it simplifies the workflow:

1. copy the absolute path to a file by invoking the file path copier (<kbd>^K</kbd>)
2. spawn a shell in the current directory (<kbd>!</kbd>)
3. while typing the desired command, copy the file path (usually <kbd>^-Shift-V</kbd>)

#### boost chdir prompt

`nnn` uses libreadline for the chdir prompt input. So all the fantastic features of readline (e.g. case insensitive tab completion, history, reverse-i-search) is available to you based on your readline [configuration](https://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/readline.html#SEC9).

#### set idle timeout

The terminal screensaver is disabled by default. To set the wait time in seconds, use environment variable `NNN_IDLE_TIMEOUT`.

#### show hot plugged drives

Enable volume management in your DE file manager and set removable drives or media to be auto-mounted when inserted. Then visit the usual mount point location (`/mnt` or `/media/user`) in `nnn`.

### Troubleshooting

#### nnn blocks on opening files

Ideally nnn should not block. Unfortunately, sometimes even the same desktop opener behaves differently on different Linux desktop environments. If `nnn` does block when a file is open, set the environment variable `NNN_NOWAIT` to any non-zero value. For example,

    export NNN_NOWAIT=1

### Why fork?

I chose to fork because:
- one can argue my approach deviates from the goal of the original project -  keep the utility `suckless`. In my opinion evolution is the taste of time.
- I would like to have a bit of control on what features are added in the name of desktop integration. A feature-bloat is the last thing in my mind. Check out [nnn design considerations](https://github.com/jarun/nnn/wiki/nnn-design-considerations) for more details.
