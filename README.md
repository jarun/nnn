### Introduction

`nnn` is a fork of [noice](http://git.2f30.org/noice/), a blazing-fast lightweight terminal file browser with easy keyboard shortcuts for navigation, opening files and running tasks. noice is developed considering terminal based systems. There is no config file and mime associations are hard-coded. However, the incredible user-friendliness and speed make it a perfect candidate for modern distros.

`nnn` works with the desktop opener, adds new navigation options, [navigate-as-you-type](#navigate-as-you-type-mode) mode, enhanced DE integration, bookmarks, a disk usage analyzer mode, comprehensive file details and much more. Add to that a huge [performance](#performance) boost. For a detailed comparison, visit [nnn vs. noice](https://github.com/jarun/nnn/wiki/nnn-vs.-noice).

Cool things you can do with `nnn`:

- open any file in the default desktop application for the mime
- *navigate-as-you-type* (*search-as-you-type* enabled even on directory switch)
- check disk usage with number of files in current directory tree
- run desktop search utility (gnome-search-tool or catfish) in any directory
- copy absolute file path to clipboard, spawn a terminal and use the file path
- navigate instantly using shortcuts like `~`, `-`, `&` or handy bookmarks
- use `cd .....` at chdir prompt to go to a parent directory
- detailed file stats, media info, list and extract archives
- open a (supported) archive in vim to view its contents
- pin a directory you may need to revisit and jump to it anytime
- set timeout to lock the current terminal
- change directory on exit

If you want to edit a file in vim with some soothing music in the background while referring to a spec in your GUI PDF viewer, `nnn` got it! [Quickstart](#quickstart) and see how `nnn` simplifies those long desktop sessions...

```

Help & settings, file details, media info and archive listing are shown in the PAGER. Please use the PAGER-specific keys in these screens.

#### Filters

Filters support regexes to instantly (search-as-you-type) list the matching entries in the current directory.

There are 3 ways to reset a filter: <kbd>^L</kbd>, a search with no matches or an extra backspace at the filter prompt (like vi).

Common examples: If you want to list all matches starting with the filter expression, start the expression with a `^` (caret) symbol. Type `\.mkv` to list all MKV files.

If `nnn` is invoked as root the default filter will also match hidden files.

#### Navigate-as-you-type mode

In this mode directories are opened in filter mode, allowing continuous navigation. Works best with the **arrow keys**.

#### File type abbreviations

The following abbreviations are used in the detail view:

| Symbol | File Type |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Directory |
| `*` | Executable |
| <code>&#124;</code> | Fifo |
| `=` | Socket |
| `@` | Symbolic Link |
| `b` | Block Device |
| `c` | Character Device |

#### File handling

- `nnn` uses `xdg-open` on Linux and `open(1)` on OS X as the desktop opener.
- To edit all text files in EDITOR (preferably CLI, fallback vi):

      export NNN_USE_EDITOR=1
- To enable the desktop file manager key, set `NNN_DE_FILE_MANAGER`. E.g.:

      export NNN_DE_FILE_MANAGER=thunar
      export NNN_DE_FILE_MANAGER=nautilus
- [mediainfo](https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo) (or [exiftool](https://sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/), if specified) is required to view media information
- [atool](http://www.nongnu.org/atool/) is required to list and extract archives

#### Help

    $ nnn -h
    $ man nnn
To lookup keyboard shortcuts at runtime, press <kbd>?</kbd>.

### Quickstart

Add the following to your shell's rc file for the best experience:

1. Use a shorter and sweeter alias:

       alias n=nnn
2. Optionally open all text files in EDITOR (fallback vi):

       export NNN_USE_EDITOR=1
3. Set a desktop file manager to open directories with (if you ever need to). E.g.:

       export NNN_DE_FILE_MANAGER=thunar

4. Run `n`.

5. Set `NNN_NOWAIT`, if nnn [blocks on your desktop environment](#nnn-blocks-on-opening-files) when a file is open.

### How to

#### add bookmarks

Set environment variable `NNN_BMS` as a string of `key:location` pairs (max 10) separated by semicolons (`;`):

    export NNN_BMS='doc:~/Documents;u:/home/user/Cam Uploads;D:~/Downloads/'

#### use cd .....

To jump to the n<sup>th</sup> level parent, with PWD at level 0, use `n + 1` dots. For example, to jump to the 6<th> parent of the current directory, use 7 dots. If the number of dots would take you *beyond* `/` (which isn't possible), you'll be placed at `/`.

#### cd on quit

Pick the appropriate file for your shell from [`scripts/quitcd`](scripts/quitcd) and add the contents to your shell's rc file. You'll need to spawn a new shell for the change to take effect. You should start `nnn` as `n` (or modify the function name to something else).

As you might notice, `nnn` uses the environment variable `NNN_TMPFILE` to write the last visited directory path. You can change it.

#### copy file path to clipboard

`nnn` can pipe the absolute path of the current file to a copier script. For example, you can use `xsel` on Linux or `pbcopy` on OS X.

Sample Linux copier script:

    #!/bin/sh

    echo -n $1 | xsel --clipboard --input

export `NNN_COPIER`:

    export NNN_COPIER="/path/to/copier.sh"

Start `nnn` and use <kbd>^K</kbd> to copy the absolute path (from `/`) of the file under the cursor to clipboard.

#### change dir color

The default color for directories is blue. Option `-c` accepts color codes from 0 to 7 to use a different color:

    0-black, 1-red, 2-green, 3-yellow, 4-blue, 5-magenta, 6-cyan, 7-white

Any other value disables colored directories.

#### file copy, move, delete

`nnn` doesn't support file copy, move, delete inherently. However, it simplifies the workflow:

1. copy the absolute path to a file by invoking the file path copier (<kbd>^K</kbd>)
2. spawn a shell in the current directory (<kbd>!</kbd>)
3. while typing the desired command, copy the file path (usually <kbd>^-Shift-V</kbd>)

#### boost chdir prompt

`nnn` uses libreadline for the chdir prompt input. So all the fantastic features of readline (e.g. case insensitive tab completion, history, reverse-i-search) is available to you based on your readline [configuration](https://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/readline.html#SEC9).

#### set idle timeout

The terminal screensaver is disabled by default. To set the wait time in seconds, use environment variable `NNN_IDLE_TIMEOUT`.

### Troubleshooting

#### nnn blocks on opening files

Ideally nnn should not block. Unfortunately, sometimes even the same desktop opener behaves differently on different Linux desktop environments. If `nnn` does block when a file is open, set the environment variable `NNN_NOWAIT` to any non-zero value. For example,

    export NNN_NOWAIT=1

### Why fork?

I chose to fork because:
- one can argue my approach deviates from the goal of the original project -  keep the utility `suckless`. In my opinion evolution is the taste of time.
- I would like to have a bit of control on what features are added in the name of desktop integration. A feature-bloat is the last thing in my mind. Check out [nnn design considerations](https://github.com/jarun/nnn/wiki/nnn-design-considerations) for more details.
