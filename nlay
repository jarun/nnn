# nlay: a customizable script to play files in different apps by file type
#
# usage: nlay file/path type/action
#
# MUST READ:
#
# 1. Feel free to change the default apps to your favourite ones.
#    If you change the app for a group you may also need to modify the opts and
#    bg settings. If bg is set the app is detached and started in the background
#    in silent mode.
#
#    The bg setting depends on personal preferences and type of utility, e.g., I
#    would start vi (CLI) in the foreground but Sublime Text (GUI) in background.
#
#    Check (and TOGGLE as you wish) the default bg settings.
#
# 2. Detached apps are not killed when nnn exits. Use kill(1) or killall(1) to
#    stop console based background apps.
#
# 3. nlay is OVERWRITTEN during nnn upgrade. You can store your custom nlay in a
#    location other than the default and have an alias with nnn option '-p' to
#    invoke it. Remember it might break or lack new capabilities added to nlay
#    in future releases. Check the file diff once in a while.
