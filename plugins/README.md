## Introduction

Plugins extend the capabilities of `nnn`. They are _executable_ scripts (or binaries) which `nnn` can communicate with and trigger. This mechanism fits perfectly with the fundamental design to keep the core file manager lean and fast, by delegating repetitive (but not necessarily file manager-specific) tasks to the plugins.

`nnn` is _**language-agnostic**_ when it comes to plugins. You can write a plugin in any (scripting) language you are comfortable in!

## Installing plugins

The following command installs or updates (after backup) all plugins:

```sh
curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jarun/nnn/master/plugins/getplugs | sh
```

Plugins are installed to `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/nnn/plugins`.

## Invoking a plugin

Use the plugin shortcut (<kbd>;key</kbd> or <kbd>^Skey</kbd>) to list the defined plugin keys and press the required key. E.g., with the below config:

```sh
export NNN_PLUG='o:fzopen;p:mocplay;d:diffs;m:nmount;n:notes;v:imgviu;t:imgthumb'
```

Plugin `fzopen` can be run with the keybind <kbd>;o</kbd>, `mocplay` can be run with <kbd>;p</kbd> and so on... The key vs. plugin pairs are shown in the help and config screen.

To select and invoke a plugin from the plugin directory, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> (to _enter_ the plugin dir) after the plugin shortcut.

#### Skip directory refresh after running a plugin

`nnn` refreshes the directory after running a plugin to reflect any changes by the plugin. To disable this (say while running the `mediainfo` plugin on some filtered files), add a `-` before the plugin name:

```sh
export NNN_PLUG='m:-mediainfo'
```

Now `nnn` will not refresh the directory after running the `mediainfo` plugin.

## Running commands as plugin

To assign keys to arbitrary non-background, non-shell-interpreted cli commands and invoke like plugins, add `_` (underscore) before the command.

For example:

```sh
export NNN_PLUG='x:_chmod +x $nnn;g:_git log;s:_smplayer $nnn;o:fzopen'
```

Now <kbd>;x</kbd> can be used to make a file executable, <kbd>;g</kbd> can be used to the git log of a git project directory, <kbd>;s</kbd> can be used to preview a partially downloaded media file.

#### Skip user confirmation after command execution

`nnn` waits for user confirmation (the prompt `Press Enter to continue`) after it executes a command as plugin (unlike plugins which can add a `read` to wait). To skip this, add a `*` after the command. For example:

```sh
export NNN_PLUG='s:_smplayer $nnn*;n:-_vim /home/vaio/Dropbox/Public/synced_note*'
```

Now there will be no prompt after <kbd>;s</kbd> and <kbd>;n</kbd>.

#### Run GUI app as plugin

To run a GUI app as plugin, add a `|` after `_`. For example:

```sh
export NNN_PLUG='m:-_|mousepad $nnn'
```

Notes:

1. Use single quotes for `$NNN_PLUG` so `$nnn` is not interpreted
2. `$nnn` should be the last argument (IF used)
3. (_Again_) add `_` before the command
4. To disable directory refresh after running a _command as plugin_, prefix with `-_`

#### Some useful key-command examples

| Key:Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `k:-_fuser -kiv $nnn*` | Interactively kill process(es) using hovered file |
| `g:-_git diff` | Show git diff |
| `l:-_git log` | Show git log |
| `n:-_vi /home/user/Dropbox/dir/note*` | Take quick notes in a synced file/dir of notes |
| `p:-_less -iR $nnn*` | Page through hovered file in less |
| `s:-_\|smplayer -minigui $nnn` | Play hovered media file, even unfinished download |
| `x:_chmod +x $nnn` | Make the hovered file executable |
| `y:-_sync*` | Flush cached writes |

## Access level of plugins

When `nnn` executes a plugin, it does the following:
- Changes to the directory where the plugin is to be run (`$PWD` pointing to the active directory)
- Passes two arguments to the script:
    1. The hovered file's name.
    2. The working directory (might differ from `$PWD` in case of symlinked paths; non-canonical).
- Sets the environment variable `NNN_PIPE` used to control `nnn` active directory.

Plugins can also read the `.selection` file in the config directory.

## Create your own plugins

Plugins can be written in any scripting language. However, POSIX-compliant shell scripts runnable in `sh` are preferred.

Drop the plugin in `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/nnn/plugins` and make it executable. Optionally add a hotkey in `$NNN_PLUG` for frequent usage.

#### Controlling `nnn`'s active directory
`nnn` provides a mechanism for plugins to control its active directory.
The way to do so is by writing to the pipe pointed by the environment variable `NNN_PIPE`.
The plugin should write a single string in the format `<number><path>` without a newline at the end. For example, `1/etc`.
The number indicates the context to change the active directory of (0 is used to indicate the current context).

For convenience, we provided a helper script named `.nnn-plugin-helper` and a function named `nnn_cd` to ease this process. `nnn_cd` receives the path to change to as the first argument, and the context as an optional second argument.
If a context is not provided, it is asked for explicitly. To skip this and choose the current context, set the `CUR_CTX` variable in `.nnn-plugin-helper` to `1`.
Usage examples can be found in the Examples section below.

#### Examples
There are many plugins provided by `nnn` which can be used as examples. Here are a few simple selected examples.

- Show the git log of changes to the particular file along with the code for a quick and easy review.
   ```sh
    #!/usr/bin/env sh
    git log -p -- "$1"
    ```

- Change to directory in clipboard using helper script
    ```sh
    #!/usr/bin/env sh
    . $(dirname $0)/.nnn-plugin-helper

    nnn_cd "$(xsel -ob)"
    ```

- Change directory to the location of a link using helper script with specific context (current)
    ```sh
    #!/usr/bin/env sh
    . $(dirname $0)/.nnn-plugin-helper

    nnn_cd "$(dirname $(readlink -fn $1))" 0
    ```

- Change to arbitrary directory without helper script
    ```sh
    #!/usr/bin/env sh
    printf "cd to: "
    read -r dir

    printf "%s" "0$dir" > "$NNN_PIPE"
    ```

## Contributing plugins

1. Add informative sections like _Description_, _Notes_, _Dependencies_, _Shell_, _Author_ etc. in the plugin.
2. Add an entry in the table above.
3. Keep non-portable commands (like `notify-send`) commented so users from any other OS/DE aren't surprised.
4. The plugin file should be executable.
