Plugins extend the capabilities of `nnn`. They are scripts which `nnn` can communicate with and trigger. This mechanism fits perfectly with the fundamental design to keep the core file manager lean and fast, by delegating repetitive (but not necessarily file manager-specific) tasks to the plugins.

The currently available plugins are listed below.

## Installing plugins

The following command installs all plugins:

    curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jarun/nnn/master/plugins/getplugs | sh

Plugins are installed to `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/nnn/plugins`. You can run the `getplugs` plugin later to update the plugins. It backs up earlier plugins.

**NOTE:** `getplugs` also downloads the launcher `nlaunch` and tries to place it at `/usr/local/bin/` using `sudo`. If it fails you have to place `nlauch` manually somewhere in your `$PATH`.

## Executing plugins

**Method 1:** Directly with <kbd>:key</kbd>:

    export NNN_PLUG='o:fzy-open;p:mocplay;d:ndiff;m:nmount;n:notes;v:viuimg;t:thumb'

With this, plugin `fzy-open` can be run with the keybind <kbd>:o</kbd>, `mocplay` can be run with <kbd>:p</kbd> and so on... The key vs. plugin pairs are shown in the help and config screen. Up to 10 plugins can have such keybinds.

**Method 2:** Use the _pick plugin_ shortcut to visit the plugin directory and execute a plugin. Repeating the same shortcut cancels the operation and puts you back in the original directory.

## File access from plugins

Plugins can access:
- all files in the directory (`nnn` switches to the dir where the plugin is to be run so the dir is `$PWD` for the plugin)
- the current file under the cursor (the file name is passed as the argument to a plugin)
- the current selection (by reading the file `.selection` in config dir, see the plugin `ndiff`)

Each script has a _Description_ section which provides more details on what the script does, if applicable.

## Create your own plugins

Plugins are scripts and all scripting languages should work. However, POSIX-compliant shell scripts runnable in `sh` are preferred. If that's too rudimentary for your use case, use Python, Perl or Ruby.

You can create your own plugins by putting them in `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/nnn/plugins`.

For example, you could create a executable shell script `git-changes`:

    #!/usr/bin/env sh
    git log -p -- "$@"

And then trigger it by hitting the pick plugin key and selecting `git-changes` which will conveniently show the git log of changes to the particular file along with the code for a quick and easy review.

## Contributing plugins

Please keep non-portable commands (like `notify-send`) commented so users from any other OS/DE aren't surprised.

The plugins should be executable. Please add an entry in the table above.
