## Introduction

Plugins extend the capabilities of `nnn`. They are _executable_ scripts (or binaries) which `nnn` can communicate with and trigger. This mechanism fits perfectly with the fundamental design to keep the core file manager lean and fast, by delegating repetitive (but not necessarily file manager-specific) tasks to the plugins.

## Installing plugins

The following command installs all plugins:

    curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jarun/nnn/master/plugins/getplugs | sh

Plugins are installed to `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/nnn/plugins`. You can run the `getplugs` plugin later to update the plugins. It backs up earlier plugins.

## Executing plugins

**Method 1:** Directly with <kbd>:key</kbd>:

    export NNN_PLUG='o:fzopen;p:mocplay;d:diffs;m:nmount;n:notes;v:imgviu;t:imgthumb'

Now plugin `fzopen` can be run with the keybind <kbd>:o</kbd>, `mocplay` can be run with <kbd>:p</kbd> and so on... The key vs. plugin pairs are shown in the help and config screen.

**Method 2:** Use the _pick plugin_ shortcut to visit the plugin directory and execute a plugin. Repeating the same shortcut cancels the operation and puts you back in the original directory.

## Running commands as plugin

To assign keys to arbitrary non-background cli commands (non-shell-interpreted) and invoke like plugins, add `_` (underscore) before the command. For example:

    export NNN_PLUG='x:_chmod +x $nnn;g:_git log;s:_smplayer $nnn;o:fzopen'

Now <kbd>:x</kbd> can be used to make a file executable, <kbd>:g</kbd> can be used to the git log of a git project directory, <kbd>:s</kbd> can be used to preview a partially downloaded media file.

Notes:

1. Use single quotes for `$NNN_PLUG` so `$nnn` is not interpreted
2. `$nnn` should be the last argument (IF you want to pass the hovered file name)
3. (_Again_) add `_` before the command

## Access level of plugins

When `nnn` executes a plugin, it does the following:
- Change to the directory where the plugin is to be run (`$PWD` pointing to the active directory)
- Passes two arguments to the script:
    1. The hovered file's name.
    2. The working directory (might differ from `$PWD` in case of symlinked paths; non-canonical). Note that the second argument is not passed in case of commands starting with `_`.
- Sets the environment variable `NNN_PIPE` used to control `nnn` active directory.

Plugins can also access the current selections by reading the `.selections` file in the config directory (See the `diffs` plugin for example).

## Create your own plugins

Plugins are scripts that can be written in any scripting language. However, POSIX-compliant shell scripts runnable in `sh` are preferred.

Once it's ready, drop the plugin in `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/nnn/plugins` and make it executable. Optionally add a custom keybind in `$NNN_PLUG` if you intend to use the plugin frequently.

#### Controlling `nnn`'s active directory
`nnn` provides a mechanism for plugins to control its active directory.
The way to do so is by writing to the pipe pointed by the environment variable `NNN_PIPE`.
The plugin should write a single string in the format `<number><path>` without a newline at the end. For example, `1/etc`.
The number indicates the context to change the active directory of (0 is used to indicate the current context).

For convenience, we provided a helper script named `.nnn-plugin-helper` and a function named `nnn_cd` to ease this process. `nnn_cd` receives the path to change to as the first argument, and the context as an optional second argument.
If a context is not provided, it is asked for explicitly.
Usage examples can be found in the Examples section below.

#### Examples
There are many plugins provided by `nnn` which can be used as examples. Here are a few simple selected examples.

- Show the git log of changes to the particular file along with the code for a quick and easy review.
   ```sh
    #!/usr/bin/env sh
    git log -p -- "$1"
    ```

- Change to directory in clipboard using helper script
    ```sh
    #!/usr/bin/env sh
    . $(dirname $0)/.nnn-plugin-helper

    nnn_cd "$(xsel -ob)"
    ```

- Change direcory to the location of a link using helper script with specific context (current)
    ```sh
    #!/usr/bin/env sh
    . $(dirname $0)/.nnn-plugin-helper

    nnn_cd "$(dirname $(readlink -fn $1))" 0
    ```

- Change to arbitrary directory without helper script
    ```sh
    #!/usr/bin/env sh
    printf "cd to: "
    read -r dir

    printf "%s" "0$dir" > "$NNN_PIPE"
    ```

## Contributing plugins

Add informative sections like _Description_, _Notes_, _Dependencies_, _Shell_, _Author_ etc. in the plugin as applicable. Add an entry in the table above. Please keep non-portable commands (like `notify-send`) commented so users from any other OS/DE aren't surprised.

The plugins should be executable.
