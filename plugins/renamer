# Description: Batch rename selection or current directory with qmv
#
# Notes:
# - Try to mimic current batch rename functionality but with correct
#   handling of edge cases by qmv or vidir.
#	Qmv opens with hidden files if no selection is used. Selected
#	directories are shown.
#   Vidir don't show directories nor hidden files.
#
# Shell: POSIX compliant
